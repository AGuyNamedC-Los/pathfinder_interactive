# Text Mockify

A [visual pathfinding website](https://carlos-castillo-portfolio.herokuapp.com/) that utilizes an array of algorithms to traverse a graph to find the most optimal path between two points
- Please allow a couple seconds for the website to load.

# Motivation

I wanted to create an interactive path finding website for the purpose of demonstrating my algorithmic knowledge as well as being a tool for others to use

# Technological Tools Used

- Javascript
- Heroku
- HTML5
- CSS3

# Github Code Navigation

- :file_folder: **gifs**: has gifs used in the website
- :page_facing_up: **Home.html**: contains all the code and javascript to make the website work the way it does
- :page_facing_up: **index.php**: only needed for heroku to work
- :page_facing_up: **pathfinder-interactive.css**: css for the website

# Road Map

- add more algorithms like DFS
- include a header with links to my portfolio and github
- add the ability to not have walls deleted upon changing algorithms
- fix the hover effect of the menu buttons
- add a better dropdown for the menu buttons
- fix the pop up sizing
